# Step 5 - Write a `seccomp` profile

It is possible to write Docker seccomp profiles from scratch. You can also edit existing profiles. In this step you will learn about the syntax and behavior of Docker seccomp profiles.

The layout of a Docker seccomp profile looks like the following:
```
{
    "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
    "architectures": [
        "SCMP_ARCH_X86_64",
        "SCMP_ARCH_X86",
        "SCMP_ARCH_X32"
    ],
    "syscalls": [
        {
            "name": "accept",
            "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
            "args": []
        },
        {
            "name": "accept4",
            "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
            "args": []
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
The most authoritative source for how to write Docker seccomp profiles is the structs used to deserialize the JSON.

- https://github.com/docker/engine-api/blob/c15549e10366236b069e50ef26562fb24f5911d4/types/seccomp.go
- https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/specs-go/config.go#L357

The table below lists the possible actions in order of precedence. Higher actions overrule lower actions.

| Action	| Description |
|:------|:------:|
|`SCMP_ACT_KILL`|	Kill with a exit status of 0x80 + 31 (SIGSYS) = 159|
|`SCMP_ACT_TRAP`|	Send a SIGSYS signal without executing the system call|
|`SCMP_ACT_ERRNO`|	Set errno without executing the system call|
|`SCMP_ACT_TRACE`|	Invoke a ptracer to make a decision or set errno to -ENOSYS|
|`SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`|	Allow|

The most important actions for Docker users are `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` and `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`.

Profiles can contain more granular filters based on the value of the arguments to the system call.
```
{
    ...
    "syscalls": [
        {
            "name": "accept",
            "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
            "args": [
                {
                    "index": 0,
                    "op": "SCMP_CMP_MASKED_EQ",
                    "value": 2080505856,
                    "valueTwo": 0
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- `index` is the index of the system call argument
- `op` is the operation to perform on the argument. It can be one of:
  - `SCMP_CMP_NE` - not equal
  - `SCMP_CMP_LT` - less than
  - `SCMP_CMP_LE` - less than or equal to
  - `SCMP_CMP_EQ` - equal to
  - `SCMP_CMP_GE` - greater than
  - `SCMP_CMP_GT` - greater or equal to
  - `SCMP_CMP_MASKED_EQ` - masked equal: true if (`value & arg == valueTwo`)
- `value` is a parameter for the operation
- `valueTwo` is used only for `SCMP_CMP_MASKED_EQ`

The rule only matches if all args match. Add multiple rules to achieve the effect of an OR.

## TASK
`strace` can be used to get a list of all system calls made by a program. It's a very good starting point for writing seccomp policies. Here's an example of how we can list all system calls made by `ls`:

``strace -c -f -S name ls 2>&1 1>/dev/null | tail -n +3 | head -n -2 | awk '{print $(NF)}'``{{execute}}

The output above shows the syscalls that will need to be enabled for a container running the `ls` program to work, in addition to the syscalls required to start a container.

In this step you learned the format and syntax of Docker `seccomp` profiles. You also learned the order of preference for actions, as well as how to determine the syscalls needed by an individual program.
